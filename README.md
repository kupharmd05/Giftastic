Actors!

Click on you favorite actor name or search for anyone you want to see some giphy images.

The assignment:
Use the Giphy API to populate a page using the AJAX function.  The page should consist of existing buttons to search the API as well as allow the user to search images of their choice.

The solution:
First steps included researching the Giphy API to understand the structure necessary to obtain information from the API.  Then create a div to hold all of the information being passed from the API.

Created an initial array to pre-populate buttons giving the user options to select from on page load.  Also created a simple search box to allow for user input and take that input to populate a new button.

The most challenging aspect of this project was getting the images to be still or animated and was solved by an on click function linked to the document.
